<p>
That's how much CSS it took to turn that 
<a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it 
<em>still</em> 
has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
	<li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
	<li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
	<li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
	<li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
</ul>

<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

<p>
You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.
</p>

<h2>Let it breathe</h2>
<p>
	Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.
</p>

<p>
If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.
</p>

<h2>A little less contrast</h2>

<p>
Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.
